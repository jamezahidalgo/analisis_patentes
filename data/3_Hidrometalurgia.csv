Method of automatic control of technological grades of crushed ore in flow, including measurement of element and general material composition of ore and computer processing of obtained data. Prior to measurement of elementary and general material composition of ore, sample preparation involves extraction of dust from ore flow formed during disintegration of material. Dust is filtered from extraneous foreign inclusions, accumulated in an aqueous medium, forming a suspension, setting the suspension density limit value, sufficient for performing the subsequent analysis by instrumental method, elemental and total composition thereof is analyzed using an X-ray fluorescent analyzer and the obtained data are transmitted to a controller, in which information on the amount of technological grades of ore of the given deposit, which differ significantly from each other with respect to beneficiation properties, is also transmitted. For each kind of ore there created are archives of data obtained during periods of time, during which supply for processing of the same process ore grade was performed. In compliance with Shewhart's statistical theory, control charts are constructed inside each archive for all monitored components, finding central lines, upper and lower control boundaries, finding, for all recovered technological grades of ore, common ranges of change of content of each of the monitored components for the entire period of data accumulation, dividing the general ranges of variation of content of each of the monitored components into subbands, within which conditions of statistical stability of measurement processes are observed and number of which corresponds to the number of recovered technological grades of ore, serial numbers are assigned to subbands in accordance with conditional serial numbers of technological grades of ore, method includes forming a table of compliance of subbands of statistical stability of measurement processes of all controlled components to selected process grades of ore and containing a composite decimal code of ore grade, each digit of which corresponds to the number of its sub-range of measurement of the monitored component. Upon completion of the mapping table, the next cycle of measurement of the monitored components is carried out, determining the belonging of the measured component values to the corresponding subbands, according to the matching table, the subband numbers are found, a process ore summary code is formed, found code is used to determine the current flow ore belonging to a specific process grade and to transmit the obtained information to the operator panel or to the automatic process control system.EFFECT: technical result consists in improvement of representativeness and accuracy of automatic control of technological grades of crushed ore in flow.3 cl, 7 dwg, 1 tbl",SOVMESTNOE PREDPRIYATIE V FORME ZAKRYTOGO AKTSIONERNOGO OBSHCHESTVA IZGOTOVLENIE VNEDRENIE SERVIS,ZIMINA ANNA ALEKSEEVNA;;TRUSHIN ALEKSEJ ALEKSEEVICH;;BONDARENKO ALEKSANDR VLADIMIROVICH;;ANDREEV DENIS SERGEEVICH,,https://lens.org/089-902-706-883-370,Granted Patent,no,5,1,1,1,0,B03B13/06;;G01N23/223,B03B13/06;;G01N23/223,,1,0,,,"МОРОЗОВ В.В. и др.

In this way an input matrix A is encoded in the overall Hamiltonian acting on the quantum system as an off-diagonal block connecting a first subspace with a second subspace. This achieved by means of ""Hamiltonian Engineering"" that efficiently uses time varying semi-classical control fields, where the values of the K control field settings at a set of n time instances provide a number of N = n K control parameters that, by the help of an optimization algorithm run in a precomputation step, are chosen such that an effective Hamiltonian with the desired of diagonal block A is obtained. The effective Hamiltonian thus obtained is then either applied alternatingly with some standart Hamiltonian in order to obtain a time evolution corresponding to a given function f applied to the input matrix A, or its time evolution is run and the canonical ensemble average sampled in order to compute arbitrary matrix elements of the given function applied to the effective Hamiltonian H. In either case the required control pulses are optimized by means of a classical compression techniques such as a deep learning neural network in order to maximize, during the information loading phase of the computation, the amount of classical information loaded into the system, and, during the computational phase, the number of elementary continuous time quantum transformations, respectively.",REILLY MICHELE,REILLY MICHELE,,https://lens.org/192-583-181-207-633,Patent Application,yes,2,0,1,1,0,G06N10/40;;G06N10/60;;G06N3/09;;G06N3/0475,G06N10/60;;G06N3/04;;G06N3/08;;G06N10/40,,5,1,001-416-855-783-721,10.1145/3313276.3316366,"S.

Field of Invention This invention relates to a technique for optimizing the performance of cyclones, e.g., operating in a hydrocyclone battery in a mineral extraction processing system, including extracting a mineral from ore. 2. Description of Related Art General Background In many industrial processes the sorting, or classification, of product by size is critical to overall process performance. A minerals processing plant, or beneficiation plant, is no exception. In the case of a copper concentrator as shown in Figure 1A, the input to the plant is water and ore (of a particular type and size distribution) and the outputs are copper concentrate and tailings. The process consists of a grinding, classification, floatation, and thickening, as shown in Figure 1B. The grinding and classification stage produces a fine slurry of water and ore, to which chemicals are added prior to being sent to the flotation stage. Once in the flotation stage, air is used to float the copper mineral while the gangue (tailings) is depressed. The 2 Date Recue/Date Received 2021-03-17 Since the volume of fluid flow of fluid through the pipe increases greatly when the central air-core collapses, the forces on the probe/sensor will also greatly increase. The probe/sensor can detect this increase in force by various means that are well known. One technique is to use strain gages to detect the bending moment on the probe/sensor produced by the fluid impact. Another example is using an acoustic probe/sensor to look at the frequency spectrum that will be significantly different depending on the presence or absence of the central air-core. An additional technique is to use a probe/sensor with one or more separate detection areas located along the axis of the probe. These one or more separate detection areas will experience significantly different acoustic signals depending on the presence or absence of the central air core, i.e. whether or not there is fluid or slurry impacting these separate detection areas. These one or more separate detection areas can be formed by creating acoustically isolated cylindrical areas along the cylindrical axis of the probe/sensor by using an acoustically isolating material such as rubber between metallic detection areas. Both the metal and isolating material should have very good abrasion resistance so they can survive the flow of abrasive particles in the fluid. The one or more separate detection areas may be coupled to individual transducers, e.g., via separate wave guides that are designed into the probe/sensor. Such wave guides could be concentric cylinders with acoustic isolation between them. By way of example, and as an alternative to the aforementioned wetted probe, the general design of such a probe/sensor could resemble, or take the basic form of, a typical audio plug like that shown in Figure 5A 9 Date Recue/Date Received 2021-03-17",CIDRA CORPORATE SERVICES INC,MARON ROBERT J;;MEDINA JUAN F;;CIRULIS DYLAN;;MERCURI JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/135-998-846-345-465,Granted Patent,no,0,0,10,10,0,B04C11/00;;G01M3/26;;G01F1/20;;G01F5/00;;G01F23/18;;G01F1/28;;G01F1/7082;;G01F1/20;;G01F23/18;;G01M3/26;;G01F5/00;;B04C11/00;;G01F1/28;;B03D1/028;;G01F1/7082;;G01F1/74;;G01F1/86;;G01N15/02;;G01N15/10;;G01N29/036,B04C11/00;;G01F1/7082;;G01M13/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
