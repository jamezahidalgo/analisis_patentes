The method of local positioning of the intruder node is implemented in Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) devices to ensure information security in mobile data transmission systems. To implement the positioning of the intruder node in closed rooms, mobile sensor nodes are used, the location of which is precisely known at any time and which are able to change the level (power) of their radiation with a given discreteness and transmit this information to the coordinator node, synchronize with a certain accuracy in network and estimate the level of the received signal from other sensor nodes with the same accuracy for all NIDS nodes. Sensor nodes determine the identification numbers (addresses) of other nodes (including the address of the offending node) and transmit to the coordinator node data about their own location, the level of signals from other sensor nodes and other data provided for by the information exchange protocol, as well as relay similar data from other sensor nodes (if they are not within the coverage area of ​​the coordinator node). At the same time, no additional information exchange is conducted with the offending node and data about its location are not requested. In addition, the transmitter power of the intruder's mobile device is not known a priori. The proposed method is based on the use of multiple measurements of the power level of the RSSI signal received by the NIDS sensor nodes from each other for different gradations of the received signal level and gradations of the power level of the transmitters, with the subsequent conversion of the signal levels into distance, for the electromagnetic profile of the monitored room topology at the frequency of the mobile data transmission networks. The collected data are statistically processed, measurement errors are excluded, the measurement error is estimated, and databases of calibration measurements are compiled, by which the distances and absolute errors of distance determination are estimated. When determining the location of the intruder using the trilateration method, from all the nodes that ""see"" the intruder determine the possible sets of space regions (based on distances from the calibration measurement database) of the ""intersection"" of the geometric place of the points of the intruder's possible location from different mobile sensor nodes.EFFECT: local positioning of an information security intruder node in mobile data transmission systems.1 cl, 5 dwg",FEDERALNOE GOSUDARSTVENNOE BYUDZHETNOE OBRAZOVATELNOE UCHREZHDENIE VYSSHEGO OBRAZOVANIYA VLADIMIRSKI,TELNYJ ANDREJ VIKTOROVICH;;MONAKHOV MIKHAIL YUREVICH;;MONAKHOV YURIJ MIKHAJLOVICH,,https://lens.org/198-285-717-383-858,Granted Patent,no,4,0,3,3,0,H04W64/00,H04W64/00,,1,0,,,"Chatfield, Brycent, ""Intrusion Detection for Smart Grid Communication Systems"", 2017.

Field of Invention This invention relates to a technique for optimizing the performance of cyclones, e.g., operating in a hydrocyclone battery in a mineral extraction processing system, including extracting a mineral from ore. 2. Description of Related Art General Background In many industrial processes the sorting, or classification, of product by size is critical to overall process performance. A minerals processing plant, or beneficiation plant, is no exception. In the case of a copper concentrator as shown in Figure 1A, the input to the plant is water and ore (of a particular type and size distribution) and the outputs are copper concentrate and tailings. The process consists of a grinding, classification, floatation, and thickening, as shown in Figure 1B. The grinding and classification stage produces a fine slurry of water and ore, to which chemicals are added prior to being sent to the flotation stage. Once in the flotation stage, air is used to float the copper mineral while the gangue (tailings) is depressed. The 2 Date Recue/Date Received 2021-03-17 Since the volume of fluid flow of fluid through the pipe increases greatly when the central air-core collapses, the forces on the probe/sensor will also greatly increase. The probe/sensor can detect this increase in force by various means that are well known. One technique is to use strain gages to detect the bending moment on the probe/sensor produced by the fluid impact. Another example is using an acoustic probe/sensor to look at the frequency spectrum that will be significantly different depending on the presence or absence of the central air-core. An additional technique is to use a probe/sensor with one or more separate detection areas located along the axis of the probe. These one or more separate detection areas will experience significantly different acoustic signals depending on the presence or absence of the central air core, i.e. whether or not there is fluid or slurry impacting these separate detection areas. These one or more separate detection areas can be formed by creating acoustically isolated cylindrical areas along the cylindrical axis of the probe/sensor by using an acoustically isolating material such as rubber between metallic detection areas. Both the metal and isolating material should have very good abrasion resistance so they can survive the flow of abrasive particles in the fluid. The one or more separate detection areas may be coupled to individual transducers, e.g., via separate wave guides that are designed into the probe/sensor. Such wave guides could be concentric cylinders with acoustic isolation between them. By way of example, and as an alternative to the aforementioned wetted probe, the general design of such a probe/sensor could resemble, or take the basic form of, a typical audio plug like that shown in Figure 5A 9 Date Recue/Date Received 2021-03-17",CIDRA CORPORATE SERVICES INC,MARON ROBERT J;;MEDINA JUAN F;;CIRULIS DYLAN;;MERCURI JOSEPH,,https://lens.org/135-998-846-345-465,Granted Patent,no,0,0,10,10,0,B04C11/00;;G01M3/26;;G01F1/20;;G01F5/00;;G01F23/18;;G01F1/28;;G01F1/7082;;G01F1/20;;G01F23/18;;G01M3/26;;G01F5/00;;B04C11/00;;G01F1/28;;B03D1/028;;G01F1/7082;;G01F1/74;;G01F1/86;;G01N15/02;;G01N15/10;;G01N29/036,B04C11/00;;G01F1/7082;;G01M13/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
